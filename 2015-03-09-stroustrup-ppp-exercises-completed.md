# Exercises from Stroustrup's "Programming" completed

They were a long time in the making, but today, I completed the last of the
exercises from Stroustrup's "[Programming &ndash; Principles and Practice Using
C++][ppp]" (the first edition, to be precise).

Stroustrup provides sample solutions for some exercises on the book website,
but only a few, and I often wished for more so I could compare what I've
produced. If anybody else is looking for solutions, they are in my [PPP
repository][repo]. Provided as is.
