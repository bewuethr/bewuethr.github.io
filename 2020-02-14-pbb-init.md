# Pbb init and index links

`pbb` now adds a link to the index page to every page on the blog. The link
doubles as the blog title, and the index page now has the heading "All posts".

It has learned a new command as well: `pbb init` initializes a blog in an empty
Git repository. It

- creates the `source` branch,
- adds the `artifacts` directory to the `.gitignore` file,
- prompts for the blog title (which is no longer hardcoded),
- creates the `includes` and `images` directories,
- creates a header file with the blog title for the link mentioned above, and
- creates a dummy post.

I'm thinking of renaming the `images` directory to something like `assets` or
`static` and have pandoc look for it with the `--resource-path` option; that'd
save some typing when writing posts.
