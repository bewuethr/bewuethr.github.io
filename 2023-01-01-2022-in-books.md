I was quite happy with this post format [a year ago][2021inbooks], so here's a
list of very short book reviews for what I've read in 2022. Way more fiction,
compared to none at all a year ago!

[2021inbooks]: <2022-01-01-2021-in-books.html>

## Responsive Web Design

![[*Responsive Web Design*][rwd], 2nd ed., by Ethan
Marcotte](images/2023-01-01-rwd-cover.jpg)

[rwd]: <https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design>

Reading this was part of my long-term low-priority project "read all *A Book
Apart* books", because they're nice and short, and they help extend my
backend-focused horizons. The second edition is from 2015, so there's no
mention of flexbox and grids, which I'm pretty sure would dominate a
contemporary version.

It wasn't all useless, though, and among other things has nice introductions to
media queries and mobile-first design.

## Designing for Emotion

![[*Designing for Emotion*][dfe], 2nd ed., by Aarron
Walter](images/2023-01-01-dfe-cover.jpg)

[dfe]: <https://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion>

I found this pretty interesting because it comes with lots of examples of
companies I'm familiar with, and I could always think about the design of the
product of the company I work for as well. As always, I was thrilled to find
references to books I've read previously, such as applying the "Peak-end Rule"
from [*Thinking, Fast and Slow*][tfas] to figure out when to talk how to a
user. Like, you probably shouldn't solicit an app store review right after the
user has encountered an error. (Unless you'd like to have a really low rating,
of course.)

## Eloquent JavaScript

![[*Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming*][ejs], 3rd ed.,
by Marijn Haverbeke](images/2023-01-01-ejs-cover.jpg)

[ejs]: <https://eloquentjavascript.net/>

This was my third attempt at reading this. The first time around I had made it
through the first two parts, then for some reason I stopped for a long time and
started over, and then the third edition of the book came out and I kind of had
to start over again.

In any case, this time I finished, and I think it's an excellent book! The
exercises are fun and insightful, the online playground is well done, and it's
fully open source. I did all the [exercises], and two silly creations from
there now even have a permanent home on my blog ([here][ex1] and [here][ex2]).

[exercises]: <https://github.com/bewuethr/exercises/tree/main/eloquent_js>

## Employee Surveys That Work

![[*Employee Survyes That Work: Improving Design, Use, and Organizational
Impact*][estw] by Alec Levenson](images/2023-01-01-estw-cover.jpg)

[estw]: <https://ceo.usc.edu/2014/05/26/employee-surveys-that-work-improving-design-use-and-organizational-impact/>

I was doing a survey for developers at work, and wanted to read something to
help me avoid mistakes. This was nice and short, though I'm not sure how useful
it really was. In the end, I drew a lot more value from the [*Developer
Productivity Survey*][devprod] article by Will Larson on his Infrastructure
Engineering website.

[devprod]: <https://infraeng.dev/developer-survey/>

## 1984

![[*1984*][1984] by George Orwell](images/2023-01-01-1984-cover.jpg)

[1984]: <https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/56487/1984-by-orwell-george/9780141036144>

I'm trying to (re-)read classics I definitely wasn't able to appreciate when
told to read them in high school (like *Brave New World*, which I re-read in
2019), or this one, which I haven't read before. I'm not going to bother and
try to add a meaningful review here, but I enjoyed it a lot, and the
speakers/screens in every room... I think that prediction has come true
:grimacing:

## The Psychology of Money

![[*The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and
Happiness*][pom] by Morgan Housel](images/2023-01-01-pom-cover.jpg)

[pom]: <https://www.harriman-house.com/psychologyofmoney>

We read this in the book club at work. It's based on the [essay of the same
name][pomessay], and my slightly snarky review would be that just reading the
essay probably is a much better bang for buck. I didn't hate it, but I also
didn't feel like it gave me some deep insights. I will read the essay at some
point, though, and maybe walk back this assessment.

If I had to pick one thing I *did* like, it's the notion of "wealth is what you
don't see": the "cars not purchased", the "upgrade declined".

> It's assets in the bank that haven't yet been converted into the stuff you
> see.

## The DevOps Handbook

![[*The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, &
Security in Technology Organizations*][doh] by Gene Kim *et
al.*](images/2023-01-01-doh-cover.jpg)

[doh]: <https://itrevolution.com/product/the-devops-handbook-second-edition/>

Apparently, 2021 saw a second edition of this, but O'Reilly only has the first
edition from 2016, so that's what I read. I think this brings the most value
when read right after [*The Phoenix Project*][tpp], because it makes so many of
the concepts introduced there more clear and concrete.

I read TPP in 2018, but thanks to [*The Unicorn Project*][tup] and [*The
Goal*][goal], there was no shortage of business books written as novels in the
first person until I got around to reading the DevOps Handbook.

[tpp]: <https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/>
[tup]: <2020-02-24-unicorn-project-review.html>
[goal]: <2022-01-01-2021-in-books.html#the-goal>

## Masters of Doom

![[*Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop
Culture*][mofd] by David Kushner](images/2023-01-01-mofd-cover.jpg)

[mofd]: <https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/96382/masters-of-doom-by-david-kushner/9780812972153>

I haven't actually played many of the more recent id games, but mostly ancient
ones (such as Commander Keen). How id has pushed what's possible technically
has always fascinated me, though, and this book is an excellent retelling of
the entire story. Plus, I love reading about places that must have been special
to work at.

## Building Microservices

![[*Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems*][bumi], 2nd ed., by
Sam Newman](images/2023-01-01-bumi-cover.jpg)

[bumi]: <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-microservices-2nd/9781492034018/>

We read this in the tech book club at work. It doesn't go super deep, but gives
a nice high-level overview of the topic. It would sometimes talk about
challenges one might encounter without really talking about solution
approaches, but more often than not, those would be discussed in [*Designing
Data-Intensive Applications*][ddia], which we read previously.

Much was also very complementary to [*The DevOps
Handbook*](#the-devops-handbook), or maybe that was just top of mind because
the readings overlapped.

[ddia]: <2021-02-02-ddia-review.html>

## Modern Web Development on the JAMstack

![[*Modern Web Development on the JAMstack*][wdotjs] by Mathias Biilmann and
Phil Hawksworth](images/2023-01-01-wdotjs-cover.jpg)

[wdotjs]: <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-web-development/9781492058571/>

This is more of a "report" than a book, and I read it because I started working
with Jekyll around that time. It talks about JAMstack as a new paradigm for web
development, and was a quick and easy read to solidity my understanding of the
space.

## Neuromancer

![[*Neuromancer*][neuman] by William Gibson](images/2023-01-01-neuman-cover.jpg)

[neuman]: <https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/293994/neuromancer-by-william-gibson/9780441007462>

I had heard of *Neuromancer* often before, and wanted to tackle a few seminal
science fiction books for a while, so this is where I started. The alternative
would have been *Snow Crash* by Neal Stephenson, which I still plan to read,
but later.

Gibson coined the term "cyberspace", and this novel is considered instrumental
in the birth of the cyberpunk genre, though Gibson himself apparently doesn't
like it being called that. I definitely had to look up a lot more words than
usual when reading, and as it turns out, a bunch of them are totally made up by
Gibson and exist only in the universe of the *Sprawl* trilogy.

It was a very entertaining read, but I'm pretty sure I haven't understood
everything fully.

## Count Zero

![[*Count Zero*][couzer] by William Gibson](images/2023-01-01-couzer-cover.jpg)

[couzer]: <https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/297345/count-zero-by-william-gibson/9780441013678>

Clearly, I thought I should go all in and read the whole *Sprawl* trilogy as
fast as possible. This might have contributed to everything being a bit of a
blur, but Gibson doesn't make it easy, either, and loves to have the story
develop in multiple separate threads, which come together only at the every
end.

As usual, I had to discover the big reveal by reading about it elsewhere rather
than "getting" it from the book itself, but that's fine---the experience of
reading was not made worse by that.

## Mona Lisa Overdrive

![[*Mona Lisa Overdrive*][moliov] by William Gibson](images/2023-01-01-moliov-cover.jpg)

[moliov]: <https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/59653/mona-lisa-overdrive-by-william-gibson/9780553281743>

The final book in the *Sprawl* trilogy is a bit more obviously set in the same
universe; rather than just brand names and the like re-appearing, some of the
main characters are actually the same as in the other books.

And, like in the other books, it was more about the journey than the
destination, as again, I totally did not get the big reveal at the end.

## The Pragmatic Programmer

![[*The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery*][pragprog], 20th
Anniversary Edition, by David Thomas and Andrew
Hunt](images/2023-01-01-pragprog-cover.jpg)

[pragprog]: <https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/>

Reading this was part of my efforts to get through *those* books that appear on
every single "must read" list for software people.

It wasn't terrible, but even though this revised edition came out in 2019, it
felt very dated overall. I did take away a few things that I haven't thought
about before in the way the book presents them, such as "tracer bullets", and
applying the "broken windows" theory to code.

Overall, though, I certainly don't agree with the "live-changing!" reviews
elsewhere, and the awful reading experience in the O'Reilly app didn't help.
Code blocks are, for some reason, displayed all centred, instead of using
correctly indented lines...

## Stolen Focus

![[*Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention---and How to Think Deeply
Again*][stofo] by Johann Hari](images/2023-01-01-stofo-cover.jpg)

[stofo]: <https://stolenfocusbook.com/>

We picked this for book club at work. It wasn't entirely useless, but I spent
lots of energy being annoyed by the off-the-charts egocentrism of the author.
"I'm addicted to Twitter, ergo everybody is. It's a problem!"

It didn't help that a few minutes of googling bring to light instances of
plagiarism and fabrication of story elements by the author... I was confused
for a while why he'd post the full length of all audio interviews on the book
website, but I guess it's some kind of self-protection mechanism.

In any case, it wasn't a *total* waste of time, and I did take away a few
things, but I'm pretty sure that was the last book by this author I've read.

## Burning Chrome

![[*Burning Chrome*][burchr] by William
Gibson](images/2023-01-01-burchr-cover.jpg)

[burchr]: <https://www.harpercollins.com/products/burning-chrome-william-gibson?variant=32205652361250>

This is a collection of short stories, mostly by Gibson, with three contributed
by guest authors. Of the ones written by Gibson, three take place in the same
universe as the *Sprawl* trilogy; since I'd already gone through that in its
entirety, I thought why not make it complete.

Almost every story has some delightful plot twist, or maybe all of them do and
I just didn't catch them. One of the *Sprawl* stories is *Johnny Mnemonic*,
which I only knew as a weird movie starring Keanu Reeves until learning about
its short story origin. I re-watched it after reading, with all the context of
the books, and it was still definitely weird, but also entertaining.

## Clean Code

![[*Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship*][cleco] by Robert
C. Martin](images/2023-01-01-cleco-cover.jpg)

[cleco]: <https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/clean-code-a-handbook-of-agile-software-craftsmanship/P200000009044/9780132350884>

Part 2 of the "read all the books from *those* lists", after *[The Pragmatic
Programmer]*. I can confirm all the common criticisms: it should really be
called "Clean Java", the disclaimer about there maybe existing other truths is
half-hearted, and the whole thing is pretty dated by now.

I did take away a few points, though:

- A renewed willingness to spend more time on giving things meaningful names
  (or asking others to do so in code reviews)
- The idea of abstraction levels and avoiding straddling too many in a single
  function
- Making an effort to make code read top to bottom, telling a story

## Sass for Web Designers

![[*Sass for Web Designers*][sass] by Dan
Cederholm](images/2023-01-01-sass-cover.jpg)

[sass]: <https://abookapart.com/products/sass-for-web-designers>

I skipped a few books from *A Book Apart* to jump ahead to this one;
specifically, I needed to learn enough Sass/SCSS so I could create a calendar
layout for the [Swiss Club Toronto events page][events]; that website uses
[Jekyll], and Jekyll uses Sass. So there. The result can be admired
[here][main.scss].

I quite like SCSS, and it still does a few things that modern CSS doesn't do
natively, but with [CSS nesting] on the horizon, I guess we're getting closer
to not needing preprocessors any longer.

## Dinosaur Brains

![[*Dinosaur Brains: Dealing with All THOSE Impossible People at Work*][dibr]
by Albert J. Bernstein and Sydney Craft
Rozen](images/2023-01-01-dibr-cover.jpg)

[dibr]: <https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/12816/dinosaur-brains-by-albert-j-bernstein/9780345410214>

I bumped into this in the references of *[The Pragmatic Programmer]*, put it on
my "to read" list, and then was gifted a physical copy, making this the only
non-electronic book I read this year. (And books are great gifts.)

The fundamental premise of the book is to be aware of an irrational "mode" of
the human brain (the eponymous "dinosaur brain"), and recognize it in others at
oneself. That's a pretty useful idea.

In many ways, though, the book is a product of its time (published in 1989):
gender roles are pretty stereotypical, women get advice how to better navigate
that time of the month where, you know, they're more irritable...

And maybe I was just lucky in my career, but the workplaces described all sound
like terrible companies. I'd rather quit than employ all the techniques to keep
the dinosaurs at bay.

[This Goodreads review][grreview] summarizes it well:

> A strange mix of insightful, useful commentary and questionable, outdated
> thinking.

## Head First Design Patterns

![[*Head First Design Patterns*][hefi], 2nd ed., by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth
Robson](images/2023-01-01-hefi-cover.jpg)

[hefi]: <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/>

I read this to prep for reading the OG [*Design Patterns*][GoF], which, though
clearly part of *The List*, is now old enough to warrant more context before
reading, and I wanted that context from a modern interpretation such as the
Head First book. (After *Design Patterns*, I should probably go on and also
read the *actual* OG books, [*The Timeless Way of Building*][twob] and [*A
Pattern Language*][pl].)

I was a bit skeptic of the Head First style at first, but I think I'm a convert
now. When I want to retain much from a book, I'll read and highlight in a first
pass, then go over the chapter again and summarize it. This book basically did
that work for me by repeating principles, never skipping over details, and I
guess the unapologetically silly cartoons and interviews with patterns also
helped. I didn't even mind that it all was Java.[^1]

[pl]: <https://www.patternlanguage.com/bookstore/pattern-language.html>

[^1]: Which, to be clear, I dont' hate or anything---I just don't work with it.

## The Difference Engine

![[*The Difference Engine*][dieng] by William Gibson and Bruce
Sterling](images/2023-01-01-dieng-cover.jpg)

[dieng]: <https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/59656/the-difference-engine-by-william-gibson-and-bruce-sterling/9780440423621>

After reading his first trilogy and the related short stories, the logical
consequence was to commit to reading William Gibson's work in its entirety, and
*The Difference Engine* is the next book after the *Sprawl* trilogy. I knew the
co-author from one of the short stories in *[Burning Chrome]* already.

Apparently, every few books, Gibson creates an entire new literary genre (or at
least popularizes it); in this one, it's [steampunk]. I loved all the
references to the mechanical computers and how they changed the course of the
world as we know it, and even though I (again) totally missed the huge reveal
at the end of the book, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

[steampunk]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk>
