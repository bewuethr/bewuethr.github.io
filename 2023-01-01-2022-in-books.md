I was quite happy with this post format [a year ago][2021inbooks], so here's a
list of very short book reviews for what I've read in 2022. Way more fiction,
compared to none at all a year ago!

## Responsive Web Design

![[*Responsive Web Design*][rwd], 2nd ed., by Ethan
Marcotte](images/2023-01-01-rwd-cover.jpg)

[rwd]: <https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design>

Reading this was part of my long-term low-priority project "read all *A Book
Apart* books", because they're nice and short, and they help extend my
backend-focused horizons. The second edition is from 2015, so there's no
mention of flexbox and grids, which I'm pretty sure would dominate a
contemporary version.

It wasn't all useless, though, and among other things has nice introductions to
media queries and mobile-first design.

## Designing for Emotion

![[*Designing for Emotion*][dfe], 2nd ed., by Aarron
Walter](images/2023-01-01-dfe-cover.jpg)

[dfe]: <https://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion>

I found this pretty interesting because it comes with lots of examples of
companies I'm familiar with, and I could always think about the design of the
product of the company I work for as well. As always, I was thrilled to find
references to books I've read previously, such as applying the "Peak-end Rule"
from [*Thinking, Fast and Slow*][tfas] to figure out when to talk how to a
user. Like, you probably shouldn't solicit an app store review right after the
user has encountered an error. (Unless you'd like to have a really low rating,
of course.)

## Eloquent JavaScript

![[*Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming*][ejs], 3rd ed.,
by Marijn Haverbeke](images/2023-01-01-ejs-cover.jpg)

[ejs]: <https://eloquentjavascript.net/>

This was my third attempt at reading this. The first time around I had made it
through the first two parts, then for some reason I stopped for a long time and
started over, and then the third edition of the book came out and I kind of had
to start over again.

In any case, this time I finished, and I think it's an excellent book! The
exercises are fun and insightful, the online playground is well done, and it's
fully open source. I did all the [exercises], and two silly creations from
there now even have a permanent home on my blog ([here][ex1] and [here][ex2]).

## Employee Surveys That Work

![[*Employee Survyes That Work: Improving Design, Use, and Organizational
Impact*][estw] by Alec Levenson](images/2023-01-01-estw-cover.jpg)

[estw]: <https://ceo.usc.edu/2014/05/26/employee-surveys-that-work-improving-design-use-and-organizational-impact/>

I was doing a survey for developers at work, and wanted to read something to
help me avoid mistakes. This was nice and short, though I'm not sure how useful
it really was. In the end, I drew a lot more value from the [*Developer
Productivity Survey*][devprod] article by Will Larson on his Infrastructure
Engineering website.

## 1984

![[*1984*][1984] by George Orwell](images/2023-01-01-1984-cover.jpg)

[1984]: <https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/56487/1984-by-orwell-george/9780141036144>

I'm trying to (re-)read classics I definitely wasn't able to appreciate when
told to read them in high school (like *Brave New World*, which I re-read in
2019), or this one, which I haven't read before. I'm not going to bother and
try to add a meaningful review here, but I enjoyed it a lot, and the
speakers/screens in every room... I think that prediction has come true
:grimacing:

## The Psychology of Money

![[*The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and
Happiness*][pom] by Morgan Housel](images/2023-01-01-pom-cover.jpg)

We read this in the book club at work. It's based on the [essay of the same
name][pomessay], and my slightly snarky review would be that just reading the
essay probably is a much better bang for buck. I didn't hate it, but I also
didn't feel like it gave me some deep insights. I will read the essay at some
point, though, and maybe walk back this assessment.

If I had to pick one thing I *did* like, it's the notion of "wealth is what you
don't see": the "cars not purchased", the "upgrade declined".
