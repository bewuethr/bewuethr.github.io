I was quite happy with this post format [a year ago][2021inbooks], so here's a
list of very short book reviews for what I've read in 2022. Way more fiction,
compared to none at all a year ago!

## Responsive Web Design

Reading this was part of my long-term low-priority project "read all *A Book
Apart* books", because they're nice and short, and they help extend my
backend-focused horizons. The second edition is from 2015, so there's no
mention of flexbox and grids, which I'm pretty sure would dominate a
contemporary version.

It wasn't all useless, though, and among other things has nice introductions to
media queries and mobile-first design.

## Designing for Emotion

I found this pretty interesting because it comes with lots of examples of
companies I'm familiar with, and I could always think about the design of the
product of the company I work for as well. As always, I was thrilled to find
references to books I've read previously, such as applying the "Peak-end Rule"
from [*Thinking, Fast and Slow*][tfas] to figure out when to talk how to a
user. Like, you probably shouldn't solicit an app store review right after the
user has encountered an error. (Unless you'd like to have a really low rating,
of course.)
