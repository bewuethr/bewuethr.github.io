## Silvia: Being a Principal Engineer

[[\@dbsmasher][twitsilvia]]{.twitter}
[[Recording][vidsilvia]]{.video}

This was an overview of what it means to be a senior individual contributor
(IC), though at the Principal level. In Silvia's view, being a senior IC means
making technical decisions and leading, i.e., no doing everything yourself.

A senior IC is more effective if they report to a senior leader and partner
with managers; they have input on the performance evaluation of teams.

They translate from product strategy to technical strategy, and from there to
technical execution; they identify one-way ("trap") doors, while avoiding
micro-planning.

Silvia used an analogy of steering a ship into the "bay of appropriate
futures", and there was a lighthouse, but the details elude me now.

A method to avoid becoming an [architecture astronaut][archastr] is to be
involved in handling incidents; generally, Silvia advises to keep contacts
outside of engineering.

## Ryan: Focusing on the most important thing

[[\@harterrt][twitryan]]{.twitter}
[[Recording][vidryan]]{.video}

A lightning talk about a process to help focus on the most important thing to
work on.

There are bad strategies to decide what to work on: for example, inertia,
decibels, and guilt.

Ryan described his ritual: at the beginning of the week, he empties his inbox,
reflects on the last week, and then chooses his work. This reminds me of my own
process, based on [*Getting Things Done*][gtd], though my cadence is daily
instead of weekly.

To account for biases, Ryan asks himself questions:

- Could I delegate this?
- What *feels* urgent (as opposed to *is* urgent), who would care if I didn't
  work on it?
- Would the CFO (as somebody outside of engineering) think I'm irreplaceable?
- Am I better at my job at the end of the week than I was at the beginning?

## Amy: Starting a new job as Staff+

[[\@cdwort][twitamy]]{.twitter}
[[Recording][vidamy]]{.video}

Amy talked about getting up to speed quickly when starting a new job as a
Staff+ Engineer by way of asking yourself (and others) questions. Some of these
would be very relevant for the interview process as well, and to me, they make
sense in general to better understand expectations for you position, even
without starting at a new company.

Why were you hired, and why was the position filled externally? What's the
problem you're supposed to solve? The range of possible answers here included
"internally, nobody wanted the job"---which probably would be valuable to know
during interviewing already.

To build your network, try to understand organizational context; focus on
relations that violate Conway's law. Amy has a [script][knowyou] to use for
"getting to know you" conversations.

What's your job? Don't make assumptions, set expectations. Clarify where on the
[archetype spectrum][archetypes] people see your position. How do different
people define "Staff level"? How do they know somebody is ready for it? What's
top of mind for your manager?

What (wrong) lessons did you learn? Don't over-index on past experience. As an
example: an acquisition doesn't have to kill innovation; this was interesting
to hear, seeing that Amy works at GitHub, where innovation indeed hasn't come
to a grinding halt since the Microsoft acquisition in 2018[^1].

What's the first thing you should tackle? Agree on a timeline.

What are you, as a new person, uniquely qualified to do? You have the
opportunity to identify under-documented areas, you could tackle paper cuts,
you could re-examine assumptions; overall: be kind.

When do you know enough? Do you learn through experimentation, or doing? Is
there a mismatch between your position on the spectrum and the company's? (Is
it the reason you were hired?)

To gain broad knowledge: draw infrastructure and architecture diagrams, map out
a request path; to gain deep knowledge, look at the most complex piece of code,
and figure out where its logs are.

Eventually, though, move beyond using these questions, and forget about them.

[^1]: In my outsider/fanboy perspective, at least.

## Michelle: API design lifecycle

[[\@hazelcough][twitmichelle]]{.twitter}
[[Recording][vidmichelle]]{.video}

This lightning talk was technical, i.e., not specifically about Staff+ work,
but happened to be very relevant for me. Michelle described the lifecycle of an
API design:

1. Start with the quickstart guide
2. Model the domain; don't shy away from non-technical complexity
   - Learn the domain: integrate, read docs
   - Design the model
   - Test against use cases
3. Package the model: simplify
4. Test and iterate: build lots of integrations, remove friction

An impressive bit was how, as part of designing an API for checkout, the team
looked at every single checkout implementation they could find online.

## Katie: Planning and executing for the long term

[[\@ksylor][twitkatie]]{.twitter}
[[Recording][vidkatie]]{.video}

Katie (of [*Oh Shit, Git?!?*][osg] fame) talked about running a long term
project: turning Etsy into a progressive web app (PWA). The main alternatives
were rebuilding from scratch, or refactoring; the latter took longer and was
the harder sell, but that's what they ended up doing.

The whole talk was anchored around a comparison to Mars missions: "to get to
Mars, you have to get to the moon first."

The advice was grouped into four strategies:

1. Partner with teams outside your org; highlight the benefits of your project
   to, for example, the business. Look at where org lines meet, and then "cross
   the A". Network by lurking in a lot of Slack channels, and build a
   reputation for good customer service.
2. If you start with investing in infrastructure, you enable future work, and
   the infrastructure work can be valuable itself. Show that it actually is for
   every step; break the work down such that each step provides value on its
   own.
3. Get feedback early and often: de-risk early stages, and test each stage.
   Measure continuously: start with a measurable goal, define success, and
   measure and track over time. If an increment is non-shippable: simulate
   ("send out rovers"), and run temporary experiments.
4. Architect as a force multiplier: where an architect provides technical
   direction, the tech lead breaks the work down. The architect role can change
   over time; aim to level up your team, and transfer subject matter expertise;
   teach how to handle ambiguity, help understand when and why plans change,
   thinking about trade-offs, and using data to drive decisions.

## Mattie: Getting to commitment

<https://twitter.com/fiftyvolts>

1. Know your goal: convince yourself, what don't others know, what will change
2. Focus on values: deeper meaning; changing org values is very hard, use
   existing alignment, reframe goals to better align
3. Address your audience: understand who they are, what they need; more than
   formal approver, differentiate between goals and audience needs, proxies to
   expand reach
4. Present progress: can define success; responsible and honest communication,
   opportunity to focus
5. Open your mind: don't be the bottleneck, build context in others, help
   others make your idea their own

## Bobby: Inefficiency challenges at datacenter scale

<https://twitter.com/BobbyD_FL>

- SRE: avoid operational burden; don't get paged because you didn't plan for
  capacity
- Datacenter scale: Twitter runs their own datacenters and builds their own
  computers
- Default node (standard hardware)
- Compute and storage
- Compute runs on Aurora and Mesos; CPU most important
- Storage: key value store, blob store; CPU least important
- Idea: better utilize CPU in storage
- Leveraged cgroups and namespaces
- Combine storage and compute in a single node, cut hardware cost in half,
  created 10% capacity for "free"

## Leslie: Influencing

<https://twitter.com/LeslieAChapman>

- Influencing without direct reports and budget
- Learning from social media influencers
- Name recognition: can't influence if nobody knows who you are; start by
  bragging about achievements
- Personal brand: things you like (cat lady), clothing, what you do
- People should want to work with you: build trust; finish things (requires
  focusing)
- Know when to say no, set realistic expectations regarding your involvement;
  point to other people who can help
- Listen: you'll better understand how to help if you give people space; be an
  idea aggregator
- Building a network: share your influence, be a sponsor/mentor; learn to
  delegate
- Work to put yourself out of a job
- Diversification: be involved in as many projects as you can (but what about
  saying no?)
- Get outside the office: give back to the community, volunteer, it might take
  you places!

## Alice: Accessibility

<https://twitter.com/AliceLiCode>

- Solve for one, extend to many (ramps: wheelchairs, but also strollers)
- Screen readers: remember ancient HTML that was already semantic; CSS
  introduced "divitis", and only later semantic HTML became popular
- Landmark navigation: give context for screenreaders
- Language attributes as hint for screenreaders
- Light mode on screens causes digital eye strain; dark mode is easier on the
  eyes and improves legibility; but respect user preference

## Scott: Ambiguous projects

<https://twitter.com/scott_triglia>

- Projects where you can't even see the proper outline, unknown tech, new team
  dynamics
- Also an opportunity: you can make it what you want it to be
- The closer to the level "mission statement" you get, the less clear things
  are
- Before project: ambiguous goals (customers unimpressed, poorly targeted) -
  write a product brief (PRFAQ); provide specificity and clarity
- Who needs to be involved? Be specific (e.g., RACI), have stakeholders review
  product brief; tight group of visionaries (heist team assembly montage)
- Define intent early and iterate; provide a "known mediocre" proposal instead
  of trying to be perfect
- If you get lost talking about the project, workshop the right words and be
  very consistent
- Execution: accelerate out of the unknown; keep an eye out toward surprises;
  socialize and get feedback; log and broadcast decisions in public (articles:
  "technical decision-making and alignment in a remote culture", "don't ask
  forgiveness, radiate intent"); produce frequent incremental value
- Exit criteria: pick a finish line and repeat it a lot
- Managing yourself: you can protect the team from uncertainty; radiate
  resilience and calm when you hear bad news; bend and adjust with pressure
- Exploring the frontier of what you're comfortable with can lead to tremendous
  growth

## John: Decision buy-in

<https://twitter.com/JohnRiv>

- Decision: most senior engineer? Everybody votes? Wisdom of the crowds?
  Multiple independent judgments > individual expert judgment
- Watch out for anchoring; form opinions before knowing other opinions;
  interpret disagreements correctly, pre-commit to decision strategy, eliminate
  emotions
- Saaty: analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
- Goal: choosing the most suitable leader
- Criteria: experience, etc.
- Alternatives: candidates
- Start with pairwise comparisons per criterion, then compare criteria
- Table per criterion with reciprocal scoring, gives you a priority vector, get
  weighted values
- Source weights by survey or story point like discussion, which could be more
  valuable than the tool outcome itself
- AHP retrospective: used successfully by multiple teams; graphs can be used in
  ADRs; trying to hide the data from the process doesn't work because of
  nemawashi (building consensus openly, and not forcing consensus openly)

## Bryan: Building bridges

<https://twitter.com/bryanl>

- There is no road, it's all swamp
- There is no how-to
- Leading without being the boss: be a good example
- It's about scope: you go up, scope increases
- Influence: if you 2x five people, you're a 10x engineer
- Learn to delegate: search for levels of delegation online
- Be a bridge: connect things that don't want to be together
- Failure and shame: build a culture that is tolerant of failure
- Input vs. outputs: you can't control the outputs, so don't think about them;
  you can't will the outcomes
- Golden circle: why, how, what; we tend to focus on the what and forget to ask
  about the why
- Write things down
- Embrace uncertainty
- Don't stop growing

## David: Building peer groups

<https://twitter.com/DavidDaly44>

- Examples: new hire peer groups, peer group for new engineering managers
- Staff engineer community: low barrier of entry (Slack channel, Google group,
  zoom calls twice a month, occasional dinner)
- Mostly talking to each other, bring up issues, identify common problems
- New: start tech talk series, mentorship program; not limited to, but run by
  Staff+
- Get the scope right; 50 people total, 10 in a zoom call
- Self-organize the group
- Hire people who care about community
- Group should provide value for its members; for example, having a sympathetic
  ear
