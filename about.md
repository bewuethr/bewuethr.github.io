This is where I collect things I've encountered while tinkering with C++ and thought were interesting, or solutions to problems I've been searching for and was not able to find elsewhere.

The easiest way to contact me is via Twitter.

The teapot? Just your average [Utah teapot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot) with [Perlin noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) modified to generate a [wood structure](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/randomnoise.html#Wood) &ndash; part of work for a ray tracer for a class I took during my [ETH](http://www.ethz.ch) days.
