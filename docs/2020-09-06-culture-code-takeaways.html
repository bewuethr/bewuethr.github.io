<p>Just like my <a
href="2020-07-07-thinking-fast-slow-takeaways.html">post for “Thinking,
Fast and Slow”</a>, this isn’t a review per se, and also not a summary;
it’s an abridged version of my notes with my main takeaways.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cover of <em>The Culture
Code</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="http://danielcoyle.com/the-culture-code/"><em>The Culture
Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups</em></a> was the tenth
book for our book club at work, and in terms of meeting attendance, it
was one of the more successful choices. Some people even joined halfway
through—previously unheard of. We ended up with about five to six people
attending most meetings.</p>
<p>The moderate pace probably helped as well: we read two chapters per
week, which turned out to be doable in two lunch breaks. Compared to
<em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, this was a lot less challenging. There
was some overlap and a few references to topics covered in TFaS, but it
didn’t feel redundant. For a while it felt like TCC is a lot less
scientific (and it probably is), but it does come with many references;
they’re just not linked to from the main text like in TFaS.</p>
<p>The book is split into three parts, each covering a skill considered
to be essential for high-performing groups; each part ends with a
chapter with specific recommendations for things to do. Together, these
last chapters make for a neat summary of the book.</p>
<h1 id="build-safety">Build safety</h1>
<p>Much of the book consists of telling stories about and giving
examples of successful teams, which turned out to be good topics to talk
about in the book club sessions. My favourite stories from the first
part were these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking a stranger to use their phone has a 400% higher success rate
if you say “sorry about the rain” before asking, to establish a bond and
signal “we’re together in this”.</li>
<li>When asked about the most impressive interaction they had with their
coach Gregg Popovich, San Antonio Spurs players would talk about how he
handled losing an important game instead of some grand success.</li>
<li>Tony Hsieh, the founder of Zappos (who just <a
href="https://footwearnews.com/2020/business/executive-moves/zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh-steps-down-1203045974/">stepped
down</a>), considers himself the “architect of the greenhouse” and
creates as many “collisions” as possible to bring the right people
together.</li>
</ul>
<p>In discussing, we often try to see how we’d be able to map these
things to software engineering, or how they apply to an all-remote
world. For example, many of the belonging cues described for group
interactions are kind of difficult to practice in video meetings—there’s
just no good way to have side conversations, for example. Or body
language doesn’t translate well: when I lean in, it just means that my
head is bigger on somebody else’s screen.</p>
<p>My main takeaways were these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate that your ideas aren’t special in any way: invite
criticism, create a culture of speaking up if something doesn’t seem to
make sense.</li>
<li>Time invested into hiring the right people is well invested. This
seems to be a recurring pattern in pretty much all the books we read:
with good people, anything is possible.</li>
<li>Eliminate bad apples: this reminded me of <a
href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/"><em>Radical
Candor</em></a>, where keeping a poorly performing employee around
because it’s difficult to talk about their performance is shown to hurt
everybody, including the employee. Here, it’s less about performance,
but being a bad influence on team dynamics.</li>
<li>Members of highly successful teams aren’t oriented around achieving
happiness, but solving hard problems.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="share-vulnerability">Share vulnerability</h1>
<p>Favourite examples from this part:</p>
<ul>
<li>The communication style employed in the cockpit of Flight 232 in a
barely controllable airplane; the closest situation from our software
experience we could think of was dealing with a production incident
(where, again, communication is made more difficult in a remote working
environment).</li>
<li>The Pink Panthers; I went and watched the documentary mentioned in
the book, which was quite interesting.</li>
<li>Talking to Harry Nyquist as the commonality between the most
prolific researchers at Bell Labs; for more stories from Bell Labs, I
highly recommend reading Brian Kernighan’s <a
href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/memoir.html"><em>Unix: A History
and a Memoir</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And my main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to improve a team’s cohesion is “hard, hard training”.</li>
<li>You want an environment that encourages candor: well-led retros and
postmortems come to mind. Also, there’s a difference between candor and
“brutal honesty”.</li>
<li>Hold back with suggesting solutions in a conversation.</li>
<li>Improving a process is uncomfortable; embrace that.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that I found a bit weird was around the recommendation to
use “flash mentoring”, which is “like mentoring, but just for a few
hours”. The strange part was the description of how mentoring apparently
usually works: “pick someone you want to learn from and shadow them”.
Isn’t there something missing in that formula, such as the consent of
the potential mentor?</p>
<h1 id="establish-purpose">Establish purpose</h1>
<p>Favourite examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Credo was instrumental for alignment in a
crisis, which worked because people knew it, understood it, and agreed
with it.</li>
<li>Simply telling a teacher that a (randomly selected) student has high
potential makes the teacher treat that student in a way that makes them
more successful.</li>
<li>How fast a surgery team picks up a new technique is not mostly
determined by their skill or experience, but by how they interact and
learn as a team.</li>
<li>Simple, but effective rules help the staff in Danny Meyer’s
restaurant do the right thing at the right time.</li>
<li>Without changing staff, Ed Catmull turned Disney Animation into a
success, only by changing structures and processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>And takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a difference between improving proficiency and boosting
creativity; being aware of which processes are which is helpful.</li>
<li>Simple catchphrases may seem cultish, but can help with clarity and
alignment.</li>
<li>For creative teams, it’s paramount that they keep ownership of the
creative process. For example, in Pixar BrainTrusts, people are allowed
to point out flaws with a film, but not make suggestions how to improve
them. This maps well to the textbook “autonomous team” in an agile
software development environment: they get problems to solve, not
features to implement.</li>
</ul>
