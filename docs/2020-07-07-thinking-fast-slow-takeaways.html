<p>We’ve recently read <a
href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557"><em>Thinking, Fast
and Slow</em></a> in the book club at work. The book took its toll in
the form of everybody except three people giving up sooner or later, and
I’ll admit that I found it hard work to get through: I’d have to
highlight while reading, and then write a short summary for each
chapter, or everything would be a total blur after a few weeks.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cover of <em>Thinking, Fast and
Slow</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’m not going to summarize the book—there are a <em>lot</em> of
summaries out there already—and I’m not really going to review it (see
<a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Goodreads</a>
for more than 9000 reviews in English alone). Instead, I want to
summarize my concrete takeaways.</p>
<h1 id="make-people-clean-their-dishes">Make people clean their
dishes</h1>
<p>Chapter 4 (“The Associative Machine”) talks about an “honesty box”
that was set up in a university kitchen: people put money in it for the
milk they took. Next to the box was a picture, and the observation was
that the amount left per litre of milk increased when there was a poster
with eyes on the wall (as opposed to, say, flowers). The context is
“priming”.</p>
<p>At work, I’m sometimes annoyed when people leave their dirty dishes
in the sink (or I used to be, before working from home full-time). I
always wanted to put up a picture of a security camera as a
tongue-in-cheek reminder, and the experiment seems to confirm that this
kind of thing would actually have a measurable impact.</p>
<p>The takeaway would be to put up such a picture for real; I’ll revisit
next year, I guess!</p>
<h1 id="avoid-biasing-each-other">Avoid biasing each other</h1>
<p>In Chapter 7 (“A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions”), the <em>Halo
effect</em> is discussed; an example is judging essays, where the
quality of the first essay by a student would affect how the second one
would be judged. Kahneman describes how he adopted a new procedure where
he’d judge all first answers, then all second answers, and made sure to
not see how the first one was graded when looking at the second one.</p>
<p>A side effect of this was feeling less confident about the
grading.</p>
<p>My takeaway: when soliciting ideas in a meeting or discussing a
candidate after an interview, everybody should write down what they want
to say first; otherwise, the first statement is going to bias all
others.</p>
<h1 id="you-dont-know-what-you-dont-see">You don’t know what you don’t
see</h1>
<p>Chapter 12 (“The Science of Availability”) has an example where
couples were asked how much they think they contribute to doing
household chores, and the answers always summed up to more than 100% per
couple.</p>
<p>I know of 100% of the instances where I did something (because I was
there), but I’m going to miss work others did—I shouldn’t assume it
didn’t happen just because I’m not aware of it.</p>
<h1 id="interview-with-simple-checklists">Interview with simple
checklists</h1>
<p>People are poor judges when evaluating complex information; as per
Chapter 21 (“Intuition vs. Formulas”), simple algorithms perform better
than experts. There are great examples with an algorithm that predicts
wine prices based on a few weather inputs, and the Apgar test to assess
if the breathing of a newborn should be considered normal or not.</p>
<p>Applied to interviews, the recommendation is to use a list of
qualities desired in a candidate with associated questions each, and the
interviewer should more or less just go through these questions. If the
interviewer does <em>not</em> make the final decision on hire / no hire,
they can be allowed to add a summary judgment, which can be given quite
some weight; if they make the decision, they should only use the list of
questions.</p>
<h1 id="use-premortems-to-counter-the-planning-fallacy">Use premortems
to counter the planning fallacy</h1>
<p>People overestimate how good they are at something something because
they substitute that assessment by how comfortable they feel doing it;
this results in everybody thinking they’re an above average driver, or
many movie releases falling on the same weekend (Chapter 24, “The Engine
of Capitalism”).</p>
<p>Optimism can help with resilience, and in some cases, falsehoods are
preferred to honest uncertainties (from a doctor, for example); it can
also lead to entrepreneurs continuing their efforts even when they have
been told reliably that their chances are bad.</p>
<p>The <em>premortem</em> is a method to remedy the planning fallacy
somewhat: when close to a decision, people should describe how, one year
in the future, the plan completely and utterly failed. This can overcome
groupthink, legitimize doubt, and uncover threats.</p>
<h1 id="take-a-broad-view-on-gambles">Take a broad view on gambles</h1>
<p>When faced with a gamble, people tend to prefer a guaranteed gain of
less than the expected value over the risk of not getting anything at
all (Chapter 31, “Risk Policies”).</p>
<p>Instead, one should prefer the gamble if the expected value is
higher—over the course of many gambles, they’ll approximate their
expected values. The gambles should satisfy these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>gambles are independent</li>
<li>a loss wouldn’t make me worry about my total wealth</li>
<li>bets aren’t long shots</li>
</ul>
<p>A concrete application of this is checking one’s investments
infrequently, for example just once a quarter.</p>
<h1 id="honourable-mentions">Honourable mentions</h1>
<p>I found a few more parts very interesting, but couldn’t translate
them to something concrete enough to be considered a “takeaway”.</p>
<h2 id="losses-loom-larger-than-gains">Losses loom larger than
gains</h2>
<p>This is discussed in Chapter 26 (“Prospect Theory”); the fear of
losing $100 is stronger than the hope of gaining $150. A takeaway could
be that if you want somebody to want something, instead of telling them
how great the thing is, you give it to them and then take it away
again—like a car salesperson letting you test drive a car all by
yourself.</p>
<h2 id="the-peak-end-rule">The peak-end rule</h2>
<p>How something is remembered is dominated by its most extreme moment
and its end (Chapter 35, “Two Selves”). An example is how pain is
remembered: longer duration of the pain overall is preferable to shorter
with a painful end.</p>
<p>And there you have it! Six concrete things to actually do.</p>
