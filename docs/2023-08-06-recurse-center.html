<h1 class="title">Attending the Recurse Center</h1>
<p class="date">2023-08-06</p>
</header>
<p>Starting tomorrow, I‚Äôll attend a ‚Äúhalf batch‚Äù of six weeks at the <a
href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, a programming
retreat. After lots of research and prep work, I booked some
accommodation and flights, and arrived in Brooklyn yesterday. I‚Äôm very
glad my combined Swiss‚ÄìToronto background has prepared me for high cost
of living, but New York certainly puts all that into (expensive)
perspective.</p>
<p>For the first two weeks, I‚Äôll stay in Carroll Gardens, and then for
three weeks in Prospect Heights. I still have to figure out something
for the last week, but I hope that‚Äôll be easier, being here and all.</p>
<p>The first two days, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, have the hub
not yet open for people starting their batch, to make sure everybody‚Äôs
onboarding experience is the same, i.e., online. The hub was closed for
over two years, and all batches took place online; it was <a
href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/189-a-new-kind-of-retreat">reopened
in June</a> for a trial period of about three months‚Äîand recently, it
was decided to keep it open until further notice!</p>
<p>Batches are now a mix of people attending virtually and in-person,
and I wanted to wait until in-person was possible again. The trial also
lined up well with my five-year anniversary at <a
href="https://www.koho.ca/">work</a>, which gives me some extra time off
in the form of a sabbatical. As far as I can tell, there is going to be
a good number of in-person Recursers.</p>
<h2 id="project-ideas">Project ideas</h2>
<p>A big challenge was sifting through my long list of projects and
selecting some that would be a good fit: challenging, but not so hard
that I‚Äôd only get to ‚Äúhello world‚Äù in six weeks, exciting, enabling me
to learn new things‚Ä¶</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the unfiltered selection, here‚Äôs what the list
initially looked like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn C and writing a shell</li>
<li><a href="https://eater.net/8bit/">Build an 8-bit computer from
scratch</a></li>
<li>Learn Ruby to hack on Jekyll plugins for the <a
href="https://https://swissclubtoronto.ca/">Swiss Club website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/">Build Git from
scratch in Ruby</a></li>
<li>Extend my <a href="https://github.com/bewuethr/bash-raytracer">Bash
raytracer</a>, following <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/"><em>Ray
Tracing in One Weekend</em></a> or <a
href="http://raytracerchallenge.com/"><em>The Ray Tracer
Challenge</em></a></li>
<li>Learn data visualization using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>
or similar</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/"><em>Linux from
Scratch</em></a></li>
<li>Build a CRUD web app end-to-end, including frontend, backend,
infrastructure; for example, a membership management tool for an
association or club</li>
<li>Build an app using QR codes to remember where stuff in a warehouse
or similar is stored (codes on shelves map to list of things on the
self)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-two-things">Choosing two things</h2>
<p>In the end, I settled on two projects: a main project, and a less
challenging fallback project.</p>
<p>For the fallback project, I‚Äôm going to start reading the <a
href="https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby5/programming-ruby-3-2-5th-edition/">Pickaxe
book</a> to learn Ruby, and after a while start the <a
href="https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/"><em>Building Git</em></a>
project.</p>
<p>But for the main course, and notice how that wasn‚Äôt on the original
list <span class="emoji" data-emoji="grimacing">üò¨</span> I want to work
on a virtual ‚Äúphysical environment‚Äù. I‚Äôm envisioning a three-dimensional
room with objects in it that behaves as if it were attached to the
viewer, which could be a Google Cardboard, or a VR headset; imagine a
ball in the room, which should roll towards the viewer when leaning
back, to the right when tilting the viewer clockwise, and so on.</p>
<p>I think this could be web-based, using whatever magic there is when
you can select ‚Äúview in VR‚Äù on a website. This project would combine a
lot of things for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>My original computer passion, physically-based simulation (that‚Äôs
roughly what I studied in university, and worked on for a few years in
my first job)</li>
<li>Something visual, where progress translates immediately into a new
thing to look at</li>
<li>Frontend web tech and new device APIs that I‚Äôve never even
touched</li>
<li>Open-endedness; there is always more one can add to such a project,
so chances I‚Äôll be ‚Äúdone too early‚Äù are slim</li>
<li>Can start with simple prototypes: 3D/VR can come later; starting out
with a 2D canvas reacting to phone sensors is probably easier to begin
with</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="but-who-knows">But who knows</h2>
<p>Two of the three <a
href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">self-directives</a> of
Recurse Center are ‚Äúbuild your volitional muscles‚Äù, and ‚Äúlearn
generously‚Äù. (The third one is ‚Äúwork at the edge of your abilities‚Äù,
which I think the previous section covers.)</p>
<p>I understand the ‚Äúvolitional muscle‚Äù as becoming good at realizing
what excites me the most, and then acting on that realization. In other
words (and as pretty much all alumni I‚Äôve spoken with confirmed), the
projects you planned working on might not be what you end up working on
in reality. Especially for me, doing just half a batch, I think it is
thus important to focus on my initial project to reach a ‚Äúbreaking
point‚Äù sooner rather than later. The one scenario I want to avoid is
realizing that I don‚Äôt want to work on a project a few days before my
batch ends.</p>
<p>And learning generously is about sharing, pairing, demo-ing‚Ä¶ one way
I plan on doing that is by blogging regularly (hence this post!). Since
this is still based on my own, very minimal static site generator,
there‚Äôs no RSS feed to subscribe to‚Äîyet! I‚Äôll try and add one during the
first week or so.</p>
