<h1 class="title">An ode to “Code”</h1>
<p class="date">2021-05-24</p>
</header>
<p><a href="https://www.charlespetzold.com/code/"><em>Code</em></a> by
Charles Petzold was the third title we tackled in our “technical book
club” at work. After <a href="2021-02-02-ddia-review.html"><em>Designing
Data-Intensive Applications</em></a>, the idea was to pick something a
little more easily digestible—plus, <em>Code</em> had been on my list
for quite a while, so I was more than happy with the choice.</p>

<p>Throughout reading, I had the impression that this was written by
somebody who is <em>so passionate</em> about a topic that they want
everybody else to be able to understand and appreciate said topic. The
book aims to be understandable by everybody, regardless of any
background in computing, and I think it probably achieves that goal—but
I suspect somebody truly unfamiliar with everything covered would have
to put in a substantial amount of work while reading.</p>
<p>Going through the book was a very pleasant experience. There was
barely a chapter where I didn’t either</p>
<ul>
<li>learn how something I’ve seen a million times <em>really</em> works
(like bar codes), or</li>
<li>find something familiar explained in a much better way than I’ve
ever seen before (such as two’s complement, or floating point rounding
errors), or</li>
<li>build an understanding of something I only had a fuzzy idea about
(like how a CPU works).</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words: many, many “A-ha!” moments.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, I’ve read <a
href="http://jongertner.net/the-idea-factory/"><em>The Idea
Factory</em></a> about the history of Bell Labs, so the whole build-up
around telegraphs and relays was a nice recap of the early parts of that
book.</p>
<p>I particularly liked the relay computer with all the “selective
lying” (or maybe just “omissions”) for pedagogic reasons: for example,
Petzold shows how to build memory using relays, based on circuitry
previously introduced—only to reveal in the end that that would be
entirely unpractical to actually do. But the principles carry over
without a problem when using transistors instead of relays, so all the
understanding gained until the reveal is not lost.</p>
<h1 id="relay-computer-inspiration">Relay computer inspiration</h1>
<p>The part about the popular microchips and their instruction sets had
me dig through manuals online, and I can only imagine how much fun it
must have been to tinker with that stuff at the time. In fact, being
inspired to do something hands-on based on the book was a very common
theme among the participants in the book club.</p>
<p>While researching a bit more about relay computers, I’ve found that a
few people have built amazing machines and produced excellent
documentation for them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/">Harry Porter’s relay
computer</a> seem to be the classic in the field</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.computerculture.org/projects/rc3/">RC-3
relay computer</a> is a refined and more compact version of Porter’s
machine</li>
<li>Paul Law writes about his take on the Porter design on his <a
href="https://relaycomputer.co.uk/">blog</a>; he has produced an
excellent <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLACadYlrOka4N5IEfm1cmSuf39ZQSQst">video
series</a> describing his machine in great detail</li>
<li>Clickety Clack’s relay computer as showcased in <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_1HsIiuOfg3QA91DUd9kGJjQoOHwlt5Q">this
playlist</a> is directly inspired by <em>Code</em> and makes a great
complement to the book</li>
<li>Ben Eater has a ton of videos very close to the subject matter in
<em>Code</em>; the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU">series
describing how to build an 8-bit CPU</a> comes with a <a
href="https://eater.net/8bit">companion website</a>, and you can even
buy complete <a href="https://eater.net/8bit/kits">kits</a> and start
breadboarding! Once we can have in-person office days again, I’d love to
start a weekly meetup where people work on this.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h1>
<p>My main takeaway is the actual feeling of understanding how a
computer works from the bottom up. While the technology described
doesn’t get much more sophisticated than what PCs did in the early 80s,
the principles haven’t fundamentally changed and still make a good
foundation when taking a closer look at more recent developments. I
often feel I get more out of what I read because of <em>Code</em>:
articles describing the architecture of the M1 CPU make a lot more sense
to me now, or reading about the boot sequence in the <a
href="https://admin.com/">sysadmin tome</a> I’m currently going through
is much more understandable.</p>
<p>Apart from building physical stuff, I also feel like working with
assembly code might be interesting. Now to find a useful project to do
just that!</p>
<p>And for follow-up reading, <a
href="https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/"><em>Computer Systems: A Programmer’s
Perspective</em></a> is often recommended as a more in-depth
treatise.</p>
