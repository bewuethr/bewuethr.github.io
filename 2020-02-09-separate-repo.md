# Pandoc Bash Blog has its own home now

Pandoc Bash Blog, which provides `pbb` (which is used to generate this blog)
has its own home now: <https://github.com/bewuethr/pandoc-bash-blog>.

[Version 0.1][v0.1] has just been released. It doesn't do much yet. Just enough
to generate this post.

[v0.1]: https://github.com/bewuethr/pandoc-bash-blog/releases/tag/v0.1
