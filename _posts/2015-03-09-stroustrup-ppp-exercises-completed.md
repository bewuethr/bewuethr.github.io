title: "Exercises from Stroustrup's \\\"Programming\\\" completed"
---

They were a long time in the making, but today, I completed the last of the exercises from Stroustrup's "[Programming &ndash; Principles and Practice Using C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP1.html)" (the first edition, to be precise).

Stroustrup provides sample solutions for some exercises on the book website, but only a few, and I often wished for more so I could compare what I've produced. If anybody else is looking for solutions, they are in my [PPP repository](https://github.com/bewuethr/stroustrup_ppp). Provided as is.
