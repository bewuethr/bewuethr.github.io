I'm currently reading Stroustrup's [A Tour of C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html) to get to know what's new in C++11. There are tons of great articles and whole books about the topic "What's new in C++11?"; to reinforce my learning, I'll create yet another list here. Some of these these my just be new to me and not to C++.
