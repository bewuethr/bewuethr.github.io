I'm currently reading Stroustrup's [A Tour of C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html) to get to know what's new in C++11. There are tons of great articles and whole books about the topic "What's new in C++11?"; to reinforce my learning, I'll create yet another list here. Some of these these might just be new to me and not to C++.

Also, this is in *no way* meant to be a complete description. Think of it as "mentions"; I'll link to articles I found especially helpful when researching a topic further.

### Declaring and initializing variables (uniform initialization and initializer lists)

I'm used to initializing variables like this:

```cpp
double d = 1.23;
```

A new syntax allows for this:

```cpp
double d {1.23};	// or double d = {1.23}, the = is optional
```

which has the advantage of preventing narrowing conversions.

```cpp
int i {1.2};	// won't compile
```

Initializer lists allow to initialize standard library containers just like C arrays:

```cpp
vector<int> v {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

### Type deduction

When declaring a variable, its type can be deduced from the initializer:

```cpp
auto i = 10;	// i is an int
```

When to use `auto` is heavily discussed; an often quoted resource about the topic is Herb Sutter's article [Almost Always Auto](http://herbsutter.com/2013/08/12/gotw-94-solution-aaa-style-almost-always-auto/).

### Marking expressions as constant

In addition to the `const` keyword ("I promise not to change this value"), C++11 introduces `constexpr` ("to be evaluated at compile time"). Functions used in constant expressions must be defined `constexpr` themselves and meet a few criteria:

```cpp
constexpr double square(double x) { return x*x; }
```
