I'm currently reading Stroustrup's [A Tour of C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html) to get to know what's new in C++11. There are tons of great articles and whole books about the topic "What's new in C++11?"; to reinforce my learning, I'll create yet another list here. Some of these these might just be new to me and not to C++.

### Declaring variables

I'm used to initializing variables like this:

```cpp
double d = 1.23;
```

A new syntax allows for this:

```cpp
double d {1.23};	// or double d = {1.23}, the = is optional
```

which has the advantage of preventing narrowing conversions.

```cpp
int i {1.2};	// won't compile
```

Initializer lists allow to initialize standard libary containers just like C arrays:

```cpp
vector<int> v {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```
